# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

RealDealz simplifies the process of finding the best deals on video games and software products by aggregating deals from multiple sources and presenting them in one convenient location for users to browse and purchase. By eliminating the need for users to search multiple websites

* Through competitive analysis, we found out that a few of our leading competitors are really effiecent at tracking down the latest and best video game deals. So, we're going to use their strengths and come up with new ideas to make our product even better.
* Using heuristic evaluation, we identified areas for improvement in our product compared to our leading competitors, giving us an advantage in the market.
* Our team developed personas and scenarios to better understand user needs and behaviors, so we could create a better interaction with the user.
* The use of sketches allowed us to rapidly ideate and visualize design concepts, facilitating quick iteration and feedback.

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

**Executive Summary**

During Phase II, we designed a wireframe of our website and had others perform three cognitive walkthroughs using various personas and scenarios to assess its functionality. Through this process, we discovered an increased demand for options to filter and sort products based on users' needs. We incorporated this feedback into the website's development, which resulted in better integration with informal feedback from the software engineering team, emphasizing the importance of sorting and filtering products. 

* Our wireframes were designed to reflect user interactions with our product, and we utilized those insights to create an improved user experience.
* Based on feedback from peer-led Cognitive Walkthroughs, it has been identified that there is a critical need to enhance the functionality of our product filters and search capabilities to better serve our users.
* The Cognitive Walkthroughs also highlighted the need for a strategic application of visual design elements, including proper calls-to-action, to effectively highlight critical information and improve the overall user experience.
