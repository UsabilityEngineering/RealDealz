# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

RealDealz simplifies the process of finding the best deals on video games and software products by aggregating deals from multiple sources and presenting them in one convenient location for users to browse and purchase. By eliminating the need for users to search multiple websites

* Through competitive analysis, we found out that a few of our leading competitors are really effiecent at tracking down the latest and best video game deals. So, we're going to use their strengths and come up with new ideas to make our product even better.
* Using heuristic evaluation, we identified areas for improvement in our product compared to our leading competitors, giving us an advantage in the market.
* Our team developed personas and scenarios to better understand user needs and behaviors, so we could create a better interaction with the user.
* The use of sketches allowed us to rapidly ideate and visualize design concepts, facilitating quick iteration and feedback.
