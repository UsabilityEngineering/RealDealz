# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

RealDealz aims to make it easier to find the best deals on video games and software products by creating an all-in-one platform. This allows users to spend less time moving between multiple websites and allows for them to find their desired product quickly so they can spend less time searching and more time playing.

## Methods

The primary method utilized in our research was a usability study, designed to rigorously evaluate our prototype by considering the direct experiences and feedback from our test users. Upon completion of each task, users were asked to rate their experience on a predefined scale and provide open-ended feedback regarding their impressions, difficulties encountered, and suggestions for improvement. This combination of quantitative and qualitative data collection allowed for a robust understanding of user experiences with the prototype, and informed our subsequent iterations in the product development process.

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
