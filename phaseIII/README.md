# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

RealDealz aims to make it easier to find the best deals on video games and software products by creating an all-in-one platform. This allows users to spend less time moving between multiple websites and allows for them to find their desired product quickly so they can spend less time searching and more time playing.

## Methods

The primary method utilized in our research was a usability study, designed to rigorously evaluate our prototype by considering the direct experiences and feedback from our test users. Upon completion of each task, users were asked to rate their experience on a predefined scale and provide open-ended feedback regarding their impressions, difficulties encountered, and suggestions for improvement. This combination of quantitative and qualitative data collection allowed for a robust understanding of user experiences with the prototype, and informed our subsequent iterations in the product development process.

- **Task 1:** The purpose of the task is to simulate a scenario where you are looking to purchase a specific type of video game under a budget of $25. The goal is for a test user to guide us through the process of finding a game that meets the requirements and provide information on the game and its location for purchase.
- **Task 2:** The purpose of this task is for the test user to guide us in finding the best price for a newly popular game called "Battle Toads" while considering a set financial situation between paychecks.
- **Task 3:** The purpose of this task is to help the test user explore and find a grand strategy game within the genre that has been specified.
- **Task 4:** The purpose of this task is for the test user to locate and purchase a game that is exclusively available on the Nintendo Switch platform. The objective is to find a game meeting this requirement and provide information on its location within the site. 

## Findings

- **Task 1:** All test users successfully accomplished the task, rating it as easy with a near unanimous score of 5 out of 5. Users found the task straightforward and reported that the site matched their expectations. However, some users provided feedback regarding the filters button, mentioning that it didn't meet their expectations.

- **Task 2:** All test users successfully accomplished the task of finding the best price. They rated the task's difficulty as easy, with a unanimous score of 5 out of 5. Feedback from test users highlighted the salient placement of the search bar at the top and expressed that the searching process was straightforward.

- **Task 3:** All test users were able to successfully accomplish the task of finding a game withing the category with the best price possible. Among the test users, 3 out of 5 gave a rating of 5 out of 5, while the remaining 2 test users gave a rating of 4 out of 5. Feedback from the test users included the observation that the category tab is easily noticeable, but there was criticism regarding the clarity of the category itself, suggesting that "genre" would be a more appropriate term. Additionally, the test users reported that the checkboxes for selecting options were not clickable.

- **Task 4:** All test users successfully accomplished the task of finding the game for the given platform with the best price possible. They provided a near unanimous rating of 5 out of 5. Feedback from the users indicated that the filters were clear and straightforward. However, there was criticism regarding the placement of the current page the user was on, which caused confusion when swapping in the menu.


## Conclusions

From our usability study, we discovered that while users found tasks easy to perform and appreciated the clarity of our filters, there were issues with the placement of the current page and confusion caused by swapping in the menu. These insights have led us to two key design recommendations. Firstly, we suggest improving the menu transition by considering a transition style that maintains users' spatial awareness within the platform, potentially utilizing animations or breadcrumbs. Secondly, we propose renaming "Category" to "Genre" to align with familiar language and user expectations in the gaming industry. These changes, aimed at reducing confusion and enhancing navigation, should inform our future design work.

## Caveats

- checkbox and filtering is preset due to the "man behind the curtain" method of simulating a webpage.
- preset data in tables meant test users could memorize information between tasks.
- search bar was prefilled out to ensure operation for tasks.
