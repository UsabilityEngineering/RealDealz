# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

RealDealz aims to make it easier to find the best deals on video games and software products by creating an all-in-one platform. This allows users to spend less time moving between multiple websites and allows for them to find their desired product quickly so they can spend less time searching and more time playing.

## Methods

The primary method utilized in our research was a usability study, designed to rigorously evaluate our prototype by considering the direct experiences and feedback from our test users. Upon completion of each task, users were asked to rate their experience on a predefined scale and provide open-ended feedback regarding their impressions, difficulties encountered, and suggestions for improvement. This combination of quantitative and qualitative data collection allowed for a robust understanding of user experiences with the prototype, and informed our subsequent iterations in the product development process.

- **Task 1:** The purpose of the task is to simulate a scenario where you are looking to purchase a specific type of video game under a budget of $25. The goal is for a test user to guide us through the process of finding a game that meets the requirements and provide information on the game and its location for purchase.
- **Task 2:** The purpose of this task is for the test user to guide us in finding the best price for a newly popular game called "Battle Toads" while considering a set financial situation between paychecks.
- **Task 3:** The purpose of this task is to help the test user explore and find a grand strategy game within the genre that has been specified.
- **Task 4:** The purpose of this task is for the test user to locate and purchase a game that is exclusively available on the Nintendo Switch platform. The objective is to find a game meeting this requirement and provide information on its location within the site. 

## Findings

The results of the usability study were encouraging as they highlighted several key strengths of our prototype, including its overall ease of use, the salience of filters and side menus, and the comprehensive variety of options available to users. Our application's ease of use was particularly highlighted in the fact that all five participants were able to successfully complete each of the four tasks. These positive feedback areas suggest that our design is intuitive and user-friendly, and provides a broad range of options that can cater to various user needs. However, the study also brought to light certain areas for improvement. Notably, calls to action were not sufficiently highlighted, which could potentially impact user engagement. Additionally, the side menu did not maintain consistency across all pages, which could lead to user confusion and disrupt the smooth navigation experience.

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
