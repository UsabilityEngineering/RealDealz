# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

RealDealz aims to make it easier to find the best deals on video games and software products by creating an all-in-one platform. This allows users to spend less time moving between multiple websites and allows for them to find their desired product quickly so they can spend less time searching and more time playing.

## Methods

In an effort to gain new insights into our product and improve the overall user experience, we utilized wireframing and cognitive walkthroughs. We began by creating wireframes to shape and understand how users will interact with our product. The wireframes were designed to reflect user interactions with our product, by allowing a user to manuveur between pages through a side bar menu, and we utilized those insights to create an improved user experience. By using this method, we were able to identify potential pain points in the user experience, and make adjustments to ensure a more intuitive design.

To further refine our product and identify areas for improvement, we also employed cognitive walkthroughs. This involved having three peers from different UX teams perform cognitive walkthroughs of our wireframes using our personas and scenarios. The purpose of this method was to gather feedback from an outside perspective from other UX designers to gain a better understanding of our product's strengths and weaknesses. This method involved a systematic evaluation of our product's usability by walking through user scenarios step-by-step, identifying potential issues and areas for improvement. By utilizing this method, we were able to identify critical areas for improvement and gain a more complete understanding of how users might interact with our product.

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
