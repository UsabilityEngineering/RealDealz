## Scottie Woodward
20 year old Male in Tempe, Arizona

Arizona State University Student - Communications Major

Scottie, like most people his age, enjoys playing video games with his friends in his free time. After he is done with class for the day, he bikes to his on-campus job at the university cafeteria. Although he doesn’t have much free time, each weekend he enjoys finding and completing a cheap indie game.

## Mark Steele
46 year old male in Chicago, Illinois

Financial Adviser - JPMorgan

Mark, unlike most in his profession, enjoys spending his dwindling downtime playing video games. He spends most of his day working 10-12/hours, correlating graphs and synthesizing information to help better create financial plans tailored to his clients. He spends on average 40 minutes commuting by train to and from work. 
Mark is trying to find the best prices of new and old video games to play in his limited downtime. With the rising cost of living in Chicago, along with the rising inflation, any deal he can get helps out.

**Goal:** to find the most affordable prices for both new and used video games, minimize the time spent on locating such deals, and maximize savings.

## Xavier Wally

25 year old male in Bend, Oregon

Aspiring Twitch Streamer - Unemployed

Xavier was a college student, but school was not for him. He always enjoyed watching youtube and twitch streams, and decided that he would try throwing his hat into the online ring. After moving back into his parents house to save money, he spends on average 8-10 hours playing video games online, streaming it to a small audience. 
Xavier enjoys fast food, carbonated drinks and a dark room. Oftentimes he finds it difficult to find a game he hasn’t played. Being unemployed with no audience and no sponsorships, means that he has to be careful on what he spends his money on less, he buys a game with no marketability.

**Goal:** to discover deals on both new and popular games, as well as titles that would appeal to viewers, and for a game he hasn't played before.


# Scenarios

## Scottie’s Boring Day:

Scottie hasn’t played many games recently because he has had many assignments due in the past week. He has become tired of playing Call of Duty with his friends, and wants to find a game that is a bit more relaxing. He would like to be able to search for specific categories and filter by price to find a cheap game he could complete in a weekend.

## Mark’s Business Trip:

Mark’s wife is going away on a business trip, and his day off is coming up. Mark plans on having a gaming session with his gaming friends, but is currently unsure of what they should play. Him and his friends are bored of the games they’ve been playing lately, and are currently looking for a new game all three of them can afford and play. His friends and him are all at different points in their life, so they want to be able to get and play a game that doesn’t break anyone's bank. 


## Xavier’s Time Inside:

Xavier intends to continue his streak of not going outside, and is looking for multiple new games to keep his 3 viewers entertained. He isn’t picky about the genre, but is just looking for the most expensive game to use in his thumbnail. Because he finds it difficult to find games he hasn’t played before, he wishes for a service that he can search for video game deals by specific console and he would also like to be able to adjust the number of results per page.
