# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

RealDealz aims to make it easier to find the best deals on video games and software products by creating an all-in-one platform. This allows users to spend less time moving between multiple websites and allows for them to find their desired product quickly so they can spend less time searching and more time playing.

## Methods

Our team conducted competitive analysis, heuristic evaluation, created personas and scenarios, and sketches to gain a better understanding of the users.

- **Competitive Analysis:** Our team conducted an analysis of our primary competitors, namely Isthereanydeal.com, CheapShark, slickdeals.net, Humble Bundle, gg.deals, and Fanatical. The purpose of the analysis was to identify their major strengths and weaknesses, with the aim of leveraging this information to differentiate and enhance our own product.

- **Heuristic Evaluation:** Our team performed a heuristic evaluation on our primary competitors to better understand the average user experience and usability of their sites to later leverage into our site.

- **Personas and Scenarios:** Our team created personas and scenarios so we could focus on the specific needs and goals of our target demographic.

- **Sketches:** Our team utilized sketching as a low-fidelity prototyping technique to explore and refine the user experience of our product.
